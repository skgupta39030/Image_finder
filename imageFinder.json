artificial intelligence: key while a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (ai) have surfaced over the last  dates and names few decades, john mccarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (pdf, 1106 kb) (link resides outside ibm), \" it is the science and engineering of making  artificial intelligence and ibm cloud intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. it is related to the  similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but ai does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.\"  however, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by alan turing's seminal work, \"computing machinery and intelligence\" (pdf, 89.8 kb)(link resides outside of ibm), which was published in 1950. in this paper, turing, often referred to as the \"father of computer science\", asks the following question, \"can machines think?\" from there, he offers a test, now famously known as the \"turing test\", where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. while this test has undergone much scrutiny since its publish, it remains an important part of the history of ai as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around     linguistics.  06:00 pm     021 \f",

perception systems. in school we all learned that we have five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight and hearing. these are however only our most obvious sense organs. the truth is that humans have many more senses than this, such as a sense of balance for example. these other sensory inputs, plus some special processing of sensory information by our brains ensures that we have a rich flow of information from the environment to our minds.  sign up everything that we know about our reality comes by way of our senses. in other words, our entire experience of reality is simply a combination of  sensory information and our brains sense-making mechanisms for that information. it stands to reason then, that if you can present your senses     with made-up information, your perception of reality would also change in response to it. you would be presented with a version of reality that isn\u2019t  really there, but from your perspective it would be perceived as real. something we would refer to as a virtual reality.  06:14 pm     05-10-2021 \f", ".\\text_images\\Screenshot (4).png": "ae jomom ue x | (qk meet \u2014 nxq-rogx-aoo @x                                   p master ~ |
